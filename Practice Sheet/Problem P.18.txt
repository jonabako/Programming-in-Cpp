Please explain the keywords private and protected and point out their differences:

a) private -> The class members declared as private can be accessed only by the functions inside the class. 
They are not allowed to be accessed directly by any object or function outside the class. Only the member 
functions or the friend functions are allowed to access the private data members of a class.

b) protected -> Protected access modifier is similar to that of private access modifiers; 
the difference is that the class members declared as Protected are inaccessible outside 
the class but they can be accessed by any subclass (derived class) of that class.
