a) using namespace std; commented out:
[Error] 'string' was not declared in this scope
[Error] 'cout' was not declared in this scope
[Error] 'endl' was not declared in this scope
[Error] 'cin' was not declared in this scope
[Error] 'name' was not declared in this scope
[Error] 'getline' was not declared in this scope

// When you use the std namespace, an identifier that is defined inside a 
namespace, you have to tell the compiler that the identifier lives inside 
the namespace. If this namespace is not used, then the computer cannot 
identify the cout, cin, endl etc.. and therefore it throws errors. //

Solution:
(write std:: before data type string, cout, cin, endl, getline etc..) or
(write using namespace std at beginning of code)

b) Critter:: prefix removed in setHunger method:
[Error] 'name' was not declared in this scope

// The problem here, is that the void function name is undeclared. 
That happens as Critter is a public method in Critter class, 
and the method name is defined in the Critter class. Therefore,
without constructor it will remain undefined. //

Solution:
(add constructor Critter:: before method name, so that we define at call.)
(alternative solution: write the method definition inside the header file 
or make the data member public)
